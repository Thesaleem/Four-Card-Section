## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

- I used this challenge to sharpen my CSS grid skills as I was quite lacking there, and also used it to create a responsive site for the first time using media queries by practicing from the tutorials I have watched.


### Continued development

- Moving forward, I'm going to play around the CSS grid and responsive design just to be more proficient while I get better in other aspect of css too like animations.

### Useful resources

- Kevin Powell's CSS grid and conquering responsive layout on YouTube.
